## instructions
Send in your solutions via pull requests by adding a separate folder per week, like this:

- /week1/solutionX
- /week1/solutionY

Be clear when you pick a folder name for your solution so that others can easily find it.
Updating and improving solutions that are already in this repository is allowed and encouraged!
